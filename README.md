# Setting up a new computer

My personal installation script for a new computer.

Note, this sets up an extremely opinionated and highly personalized installation, with my preferences and dotfiles. Please adjust as needed!

My dotfile repo is currently private, but I plan on creating a public repo before the end of the year.
